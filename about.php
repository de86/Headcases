<h1>About Headcases Design</h1>
<p>My name is David Headdock and I'm based in Manchester. I studied art and 
design at school, college and university, eventually gaining a series of 
qualifications and a degree in fine art from Birmingham City University. Since 
finishing university I have worked in many artistic settings, including colleges, 
universities, theatres and galleries. Over the years I have gained a great deal of 
experience and many skills which I use to create the custom, bespoke cases you see 
on this site.</p>
<p>I have been playing pool for 25 years, and have played competetively for 17 
years. I currently play for three pool teams, including Greater Manchester County 
Squad.</p>
<p>During this time I have gained a great deal of knowledge and experience about the 
game and the equipment needed to play the game well.</p>
<p> I remember getting my first cue and case from my mum and dad one Christmas and 
still have the same cue and case at home, although I now own more. I always wanted 
a personalised case but could never find someone who could create the perfect case 
I desired. One day I decided to put my design and creative skills to the test to see 
if I could make a case for myself that was exactly how I wanted it, the right size, 
the right colour, the right design. I wanted a case with my name on it in the colours 
I wanted instead of the same boring, simplistic cases that every other pool player has.</p>
<p>So HeadcasesDesign was born. Combining my passions in life of art, design and pool.</p>
<p>I have now progressed from making cases for myself and teammates to working 
with customers who desire something personal, specific and different to compliment 
their chosen cues, playing styles and personalities.</p>
<p>My cases are all personally designed, one of a kind and completely handmade. 
I customise every aspect of the case to the customers specifications from material, 
colour, stitching and end caps to the embroidery, handles and size, including 
interior design with separate compartments inside for chalks and accessories. 
ensuring your cues are fully supported and safe.</p>
<p>we all spend a lot of money on the right cue, so don't we also deserve a high 
quality case to protect them?</p>
<p>Don't be a Headcase ... Own one!</p>
